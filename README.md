# SQL-WorldFactbook
Practice the Python SQLite workflow using CIA World Factbook data

This is a short and simple project. My goal is to practice writing queries and subqueries with SQLite in a JupyterNotebook. SQL is a popular tool required in most data analyst job postings. 

## Main tools used:

Python, SQLite, Pandas, Matplotlib, JupyterNotebook

## Installation and Usage

Install the requirements for this project using pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install the exact version of the libraries that I had when doing this project.
